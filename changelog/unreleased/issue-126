Enhancement: support inetd-style operation

rest-server can be used as a "wait" service under inetd-style supervisors.
In this case, the "--listen" argument is ignored and the socket is provided
by the supervisor as stdin. This allows running the server as unprivileged
process, but still use a low port like 443.
